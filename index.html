    <p>“Classical music should be reserved for the elite,” someone said to me this summer while I was attending a music festival. She is a successful, internationally-acclaimed soloist who travels between Europe and the US to juggle a teaching career with a performance career. “There should always be a level of pretentiousness about it,” she went on to say.</p>

   <p>I say: Yikes.</p>

<p>The people who think similarly to this performer do not seem to be concerned with reports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-faces-a-slide-in-box-office-revenues.html?_r=0"> lower performance attendance</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/nyregion/philadelphia-orchestra-walks-out-on-opening-night.html?module=inline">increased orchestra strikes</a> in the past decade, possibly because they personally have thrived in the current state of the industry. However various stats from the past fifteen years paint a saddening truth about the classical music scene as it is.

From 2004 to 2017, there is a decreasing trend of Google searches for the general topic of “Classical Music”. Additional data like this exists, but doesn’t seem to see the light of day as often as it should, beyond statistical reports on <a href="https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/2012-sppa-feb2015.pdf"> government websites</a> or <a href="http://americanorchestras.org/images/stories/of/Orchestra_Facts_2006_to_2014_LeagueFinal.pdf">national agencies</a>. Individual orchestras conduct statistical analysis of all aspects of their business, including attendance and revenue, but it proved very hard to find the nitty gritty number findings. I hope to bring forward some of these numbers. The reports that are used for this article include a report released by the government agency National Endowment for the Arts: <em>A decade of arts engagement: findings from the survey of public participation in the arts, 2002–2012</em> and <em>Orchestra Facts: 2006-2014 A Study of Orchestra Finances and Operations</em> released by the National League of American Orchestras.

<h2>WHY BACH, BEETHOVEN AND MOZART</h2>

<p>Using academic research and opinions collected by readers, scholars and music listeners, New York Times’ head music critic Anthony Tommasini concluded that Bach, Beethoven and Mozart land the  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/arts/music/23composers.html">top three spots </a>for the top influential music composers of all time.</p>

<p>Bachtrack, the largest site for listing worldwide classical music events, released their annual report which placed Mozart, Beethoven and Bach as the composers with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/arts/music/23composers.html">highest performance numbers</a> in 2017 (for the fourth year in a row). </p>

    <p>Again, we see a general trend of decreased popularity in Google searches, falling by roughly 50% from 2004 to 2017. The dips and spikes seemed to indicate seasonal trends, so we took a look at the monthly trend:  </p>

<div id="chartContainer3" style="height: 400px">
</div>

<div>
    <p>We see a seasonal trend that results in lower popularity for the summer months of both 2004 and 2017. This could be explained by the fact that a standard orchestra season runs from September to May. Despite this predictable seasonality, there is still a statistically significant decrease in popular interest. If this is happening for specific composer searches as well as broad classical music searches, what’s going on with the orchestral scene?</p>

<p>Since 1982, the Survey of Public Participation in the Arts has tracked adult attendance at jazz events, classical music performances, opera, musical plays, non-musical plays, ballet, and art museums or galleries, which are called “benchmark activities” by the SPPA. If a survey respondent reported going to any of these types of events during the 12 months (ending in July 2012), the adult is considered as an attendee of a benchmark arts activity. Attendance at elementary or high school performances was not counted. The following information was gathered between 2002 and 2012. Let’s examine how many adults have seen a performing art in the past year:

</div>


<div>
    <p>
The 2002 SPPA counted a total of 497 million attendances by adults for benchmark activities, which fell by nearly 20 percent in 2008 and then by another 9 percent in 2012. Here is the breakdown within age groups specifically for classical music performances:

    <img src="img/2.png">
</div>

<div>
  <p>Older adults are the only demographic subgroup to show an increase in performing arts attendance over the past decade. Their rates of attendance at classical music (as well as opera, musicals, and non-musicals) were significantly higher in 2012 than in 2002. </p>
</div>
<p>We live in a world of classical performance where a sort of “performance etiquette” has found its way into the concert setting: clapping between movements or clapping spontaneously after an especially impressive section is frowned upon. Heaven forbid you cough, which guarantees a nasty look from a neighbor. Children are viewed more as a nuisance that creates noise and disruption, even leading to their <a href="http://southfloridaclassicalreview.com/2014/10/new-world-symphony-mum-on-mtts-eviction-of-audience-member-during-concert/">dismissal from the concert.</a> As a result of all this, people who want to enjoy music for the universal language of expression and beauty that it is experience discomfort in the classical performance setting. Does this contribute to reluctance in attending this events?</p>

  <p>This graph has two distinct sections of activity: during the early hours the morning (the average Americans falls <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sleep-times-america-counties_n_5942296">sleep by midnight</a>) and lunch (average lunch is <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2593219/Revealed-The-best-times-eat-breakfast-lunch-dinner-want-lose-weight-need-make-sure-youre-7am.html">12:30-1pm</a>). On average, adults <a href="https://www.sleep.org/articles/wake-less-frequently-night/">wake up once or twice</a> during the night as a natural part of the sleep cycle. It is reasonable to assume that music is used as a tool to help people go back to sleep.
