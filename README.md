# Classical music doesn't know where it's going. But the numbers might give us a clue.

A data-driven story that explores Google trends search data involving the top classical composers and the future of classical music.

## Data

- Data was sent from Google world trends for musical composers Bach, Beethoven and Mozart and for the general search term "classical music".

- Data spans from 2004-2017.

- Data is configured as a percentage of search popularity (out of 100). 

## Research Questions

After seeing the CSV worksheet, I now had a basis for creating my research questions:
1. Out of Bach, Beethoven and Mozart, who was the most popular?
2. Is the trend decreasing or increasing?
3. What might account for seasonal dips and spikes?
4. Do people listen to classical music at particular times of day?

## Code

This project was built using D3.js, Dimple.js, HTML, and CSS.
